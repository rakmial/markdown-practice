# Cast Iron Chicken Breast
## JTL Style
Herein will be described my secret technique for making a quick, healthy lunch. And when I say quick, I mean __quick__.

Here's what you'll need - 
* 1 chicken breast
* Cast Iron Pan
* EVOO
* Paper Towels
* 2 cups vegetables of choice
* Montreal Steak Seasoning

As you can see, it is not a complex recipe. But there are a few little tricks that deserve explanation so you can save time _and_ eat well.

1. Slice your breast in half longways, with the blade of the knife parallel to the cutting board. This takes a little practice to master - start at the thick end.
2. Smother those little bastards in Montreal, front and back. Begin heating your cast iron and put 1 Tbsp EVOO in it.
3. Take a little plate, put a paper towel on it. Lay one chicken half on the paper towel, and put another on top of it. Lay the other half on top, then cover it with a final paper towel. Give them a little press to try to get as much moisture as possible off the surface as you can. Put them in the fridge.
4. Give your cutting board and chef knife hot rinse and prepare whatever vegetables you have in mind. Most recently, I did Brussels sprouts and snap peas. As soon as your oil begins to smoke, you're ready for the action!
5. Take chicken halves out of fridge and lay them gently into the cast iron. _Don't toss them in, or you might get splashed with hot oil!_ Set a timer for 5 minutes.
6. Take this opportunity to start doing a little cleanup. I always try to clean as I go.
7. When the timer goes off, flip them chickens quick and set another timer for 3 minutes. Add any vegetables you want a sear on (in my case, the Brussels sprouts).
8. When _that_ timer goes off ... I'm going too deep here.
